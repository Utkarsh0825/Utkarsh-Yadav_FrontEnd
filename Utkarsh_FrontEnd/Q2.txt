There are a few issues with the code that you provided:

The useState hook is used incorrectly in the WrappedListComponent component. The first element of the array returned by useState should be the current state value, and the second element should be the function to update the state value. However, in this code, the order is reversed. It should be [selectedIndex, setSelectedIndex] = useState(); instead of [setSelectedIndex, selectedIndex] = useState();.

The isSelected prop passed to the SingleListItem component is always the value of selectedIndex, which is a number. However, the isSelected prop should be a boolean value indicating whether the item is selected or not. This can be fixed by changing the isSelected prop to isSelected={selectedIndex === index}.

The items prop passed to the WrappedListComponent component is not validated correctly. The PropTypes.array validator is used, but it should be PropTypes.arrayOf instead. Additionally, the argument to PropTypes.arrayOf should be a validator for the elements of the array, not an object with a single property. This can be fixed by changing the validator to items: PropTypes.arrayOf(PropTypes.shape({ text: PropTypes.string.isRequired })).

The key prop is not passed to the SingleListItem components when they are rendered in a loop. This can cause issues with Reactâ€™s rendering and reconciliation algorithm. To fix this, a unique key should be passed to each SingleListItem, for example: <SingleListItem key={index} ... />.

The onClickHandler prop passed to the SingleListItem component is a function that returns a function. However, in the WrappedSingleListItem component, this prop is called as if it were a function that takes an argument. This can be fixed by changing the onClickHandler prop in the WrappedSingleListItem component to onClick={() => onClickHandler(index)}.
